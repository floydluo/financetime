# Finance Time 50 Crawlers
This project started in Oct. 2016. 

This project is an open source web scarping project with the aims of collecting and analyzing a large dataset on academic publications (journals and conference proceedings) to derive insights. 

These journals mainly came from the Finance Time 50 Lists. 

A well-developed crawler scraped the data from various websites, processed the data into the structural format and stored them in a relational database. 

Some basic Natural Language Processing tasks were conducted.
